## General Info
A game of Rock Paper Scissors using HTML, CSS and Java script.
## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
  

## Setup
Using the LiveServer you can see this project.
In this project I aimed to showcase how JavaScript is powerful when it comes to making buttons come alive.
For the Rock,Papers and Scissors buttons i have assigned an icon and encapsulated in a cirlce, under them is a score, and Reset/Auto Play buttons.
Each player wins, loses or draws a score is updated respectively.
Ive added a session storage so that when a page is refresed the scores stay the same. Until the reset score is pressed.
An autoplay is introduced so that when pressed a player can play against an AI..
